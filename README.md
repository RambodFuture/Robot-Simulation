# Robot-Simulation
This is simulation that records robots path taken by each robot in a group of robots wandering around. The robots are wandering in a rectangular room. The floor of the rectangular room consists
of square coloured tiles. When a robot moves, it paints each tile it steps on with the colour of paint it carries. 
Keep in mind this is not a perfect project and some inputs are hard coded.
